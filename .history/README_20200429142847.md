# Hooks Architecture

A simple and powerful project structure for React apps.

## General Philosophy

React Hooks is the new way of writing ReactJS applications. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class, which means you can now write your entire application using _functional programming and functional components_ and this has a myriad of advantages.

Most notably having the ability to separate functionality by concern and not by stage in the lifecycle method ( single responsibility principle ) which makes the source code of the applications much more readable, maintainable and increases the reusability and portability of the components.

Hooks Architecture follows pragmatic functional JavaScript best practices and React hooks patterns to provide a powerful, expressive and flexible framework for building applications with speed and simplicity. Composability and atomicity allow teams to develop faster and with less concern of introducing bugs when modifying existing code.

## The Essence of React Hooks

Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React that have been encountered over five years of writing and maintaining tens of thousands of components, you might recognize some of these problems.

### It’s hard to reuse stateful logic between components

Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.

### Complex components become hard to understand

Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data)

### Classes confuse both people and machines

Hooks let you use more of React’s features without classes.

- idiomatic
- easier to read, declarative
- flexible and expressive
- modular and portable
- performant
- easier to reason about

* reasons of hooks

## Principles

optimize for change

avoid hasty abstractions

composition and encapsulation

reactive programming

the best code is no code

- avoid boilerplate code. the less code lines the better.

## Why React in the first place

## How React Hooks Work

## Reactive Programming

## Functional JavaScript and TypeScript

## Hook + Context Pattern

This is ADN of the Hooks Architecture, you will find it everywhere just like

you encapsulate functionality in react hooks based on concern rather than file type or any other abstraction.

- encapsulation
- portability
- testability

## Project Structure

## Scopes

If a lifetime of the data is the same as the component’s lifetime, the data should belong to the component’s state. If the data lives longer than the component, it should be received as a prop and might be a member of some upper component state. Only the data living longer than any particular component should be stored globally.

## Examples

- react native
- nextjs
- cra
- gatsby

## Production Readiness Checklist

- tests here, not before. test not too much post ref
